# Git Katas
The purpose of this repo is to provide guidance on bringing yourself up to speed quickly with Git.

## Suggested Training
I highly recommend the following Pluralsight courses on Git:
* [How Git Works]("https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/how-git-works") by Paolo Perrotta - This training clearly describes the Git object model by looking at how git objects are being stored.  Having a deep understanding of how Git works will help demystify what is happening when you run differing commands.
* [Mastering Git]("https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/mastering-git") on Pluralsight by Paolo Perrotta - This training picks up where 'How Git Works' leaves off.  It illustrates the basic local workflow, as well as gives you examples of common workflows.

## Kata Overview
Katas are a great way to learn technologies.  I put together the following katas to:
1 Reinforce the understanding of the Git Object Model
2 Reinforce commands used in a common local Git workflow
3 Reinforce commands used in a centralized local Git workflow

The katas contain the following:
### Useful commands
These are commands that you will find yourself using.  The kata reinforces the use of these commands.

### Useful Concepts / Learnings
These are concepts that I believe are valuable for you to know.  The kata reinforces these concepts.

### Kata
Each Kata is setup in a table with the following columns:
* Objective - What are you logically trying to accomplish
* Command - What is a command that will accomplish the task
* Notes - Here we will show some expected outcomes, as well as provide some learnings

When performing the kata for the first few times, you can/should look at all 3 columns.  The Command column will give you at least one command that meets the objective, while the Notes adds commentary and potentially some learnings.  After you have done it a few times, try it with only looking at the objective.

## Katas
* [Understanding the Git Object Model](understanding-the-git-object-model/README.md) - This kata reinforces the understanding fo the Git Object Model.  It is a great follow up to 'How Git Works'
* [Common Local Workflow](common-local-workflow/README.md) - This kata helps reinforce a common local workflow, including reverting changes to the working area, the index and commits.

## Feedback
I welcome all feedback!
